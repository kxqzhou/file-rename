# file-rename
A small command-line tool written in Go (Golang) to help with renaming groups of files. Features are renaming into a sequence [name][1 ... 10 ], adding prefixes / suffixes, or replacing text.

## issues
need to resolve replacing names leading to two files with the same name <br />
commands don't seem to work in tandem <br />
